    Write a program that multiplies pairs of integers.

    \begin{block}{Input description}
    Input starts with one line containing an integer $T$, where $1\leq T \leq
    100$, denoting the number of test cases. Then $T$ lines follow, each
    containing a test case. Each test case consists of two integers $A,B$,
    where $-2^{20} \leq A,B \leq 2^{20}$, separated by a single space.
    \end{block}

    \vspace{10pt}

    \begin{block}{Output description}
    For each test case, output one line containing the value of $A\times B$.

        \item Become a faster/better typist
        \item Don't let your fingers be the limiting factor of solving problems quickly
        \item Good problem solvers have simple solutions; they don't have to type as much, but it's still important to type in quickly

        \item TypeRacer is a fun and effective way to practice:

Company XYZ have been badly hit by recession and is taking a lot of cost cutting measures. Some of these measures include giving up office space, going open source, reducing incentives, cutting on luxuries and issuing pink slips.

\vspace{10pt}

They have got three (3) employees working in the accounts department and are going to lay-off two (2) of them. After a series of meetings, they have decided to dislodge the person who gets the most salary and the one who gets the least. This is usually the general trend during crisis like this.

\begin{frame}{Problem: SMS Typing}

{\small
   Cell phones have become an essential part of modern life. In addition to
making voice calls, cell phones can be used to send text messages, which
are known as SMS for short. Unlike computer keyboards, most cell phones
have limited number of keys. To accommodate all alphabets, letters are
compacted into single key. Therefore, to type certain characters, a key
must be repeatedly pressed until that character is shown on the display
panel.\\
\vspace{10pt}
In this problem we are interested in finding out the number of times keys on a cell phone must be
pressed to type a particular message.
}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Problem: SMS Typing}

{
    \small
In this problem we will assume that the key pad of our cell phone is arranged as follows.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
         & abc & def \\
        \hline
        ghi & jkl & mno \\
        \hline
        pqrs & tuv & wxyz \\
        \hline
         & <SP> & \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

In the above grid each cell represents one key. Here <SP> means a space. In order to type the letter
‘a’, we must press that key once, however to type ‘b’ the same key must be repeatedly pressed twice
and for ‘c’ three times. In the same manner, one key press for ‘d’, two for ‘e’ and three for ‘f’. This is
also applicable for the remaining keys and letters. Note that it takes a single press to type a space.
}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem: SMS Typing}
    \begin{block}{Input}
    {\small
The first line of input will be a positive integer $T$ where $T$ denotes the number of test cases. $T$ lines
will then follow each containing only spaces and lower case letters. Each line will contain at least 1 and
at most 100 characters.
    }
    \end{block}

    \vspace{20pt}
    \begin{block}{Output}
    {\small
For every case of input there will be one line of output. It will first contain the case number followed
by the number of key presses required to type the message of that case. Look at the sample output for
exact formatting.
